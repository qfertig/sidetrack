A lightweight, GMS-free Spotify client for the [Sidephone SP-01](https://sidephone.com) and similar small-screen Android devices.

Built on [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) (Rust) with a minimal [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI optimized for 480x640 displays.

## Sidephone Only Features

When a Sundial keypad is connected, sidespot enables full hardware navigation -- no touchscreen needed (with the exception of shuffle/loop buttons in Now Playing).

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Dial up / down** | Scroll lists; adjust volume on Now Playing |
| **Dial left** | Previous track |
| **Dial right** | Next track |
| **Center glass** | Select focused item in lists; Play/Pause on Now Playing; long-hold for row actions |
| **Top-left (←)** | Cycle tabs (Queue / Library / Search) |
| **Top-right (→)** | Navigate back / dismiss menus |
| **Bottom-left (Tab)** | Show / hide Now Playing |
| **Bottom-right (Enter)** | Open row actions (add to queue, liked songs, playlist) |

Additional adaptations when a Sundial is detected:
- **Fill-style focus indicators** on all interactive items
- **Stacked Play All / Shuffle buttons** in playlist and album views for easy D-pad access
- **Auto-focus on first content row** when entering any list view
- **Focus only appears during D-pad use** -- hidden in touch mode to avoid visual clutter

## Requirements

- Spotify Premium account
- Android 12+ (API 31+), ARM device (arm64-v8a or armeabi-v7a)

## Install

### From Releases

Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/jtaekman/sidespot/releases) and sideload it onto your device:

```sh
adb install sidespot-v*.apk
```

### From Obtainium

To track updates automatically via [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium):

1. Open Obtainium
2. Add app -> enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/jtaekman/sidespot`
3. Obtainium will check for new releases and notify you when updates are available

#### Switching from the Codeberg source

Sidespot used to be hosted on Codeberg. That repository is deprecated and will
not publish new releases, so if you added Sidespot to Obtainium before the move,
you need to re-point it at GitHub — otherwise updates will silently stop.

Obtainium keys each app to the source URL it was added with, so this is a
remove-and-re-add rather than an in-place edit:

1. Open Obtainium and select **Sidespot** (source: `codeberg.org/jtaekman/sidespot`)
2. Remove it from your app list. This only stops Obtainium tracking it -- it does
   **not** uninstall Sidespot from your device
3. Add app -> enter the new URL: `https://github.com/jtaekman/sidespot`
4. Obtainium will pick up the copy already installed on your device and notify you
   on the next release

You do not need to uninstall or reinstall anything. GitHub releases are signed
with the same key as the Codeberg ones, so future updates install straight over
your existing app and your login and settings are preserved.

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** (e.g. `brew install openjdk@17`)
- **Android SDK** (API 34) with NDK `27.0.12077973`
- **Rust toolchain** with `aarch64-linux-android` and `armv7-linux-androideabi` targets
- **[cargo-ndk](https://github.com/nicegram/aspect-cargo-ndk)** (`cargo install cargo-ndk`)

### Setup

```sh
# Install Rust Android targets
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi

# Clone with submodules (librespot)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jtaekman/sidespot.git
cd sidespot
```

### Build & Install

The Gradle build automatically compiles the Rust native library via `cargo-ndk` before assembling the APK.

```sh
# Debug build + install to connected device
export JAVA_HOME=$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
./gradlew installDebug

# Release APK (requires signing config in release-keystore.properties)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The release APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

### Release Signing

To build a signed release APK, create `release-keystore.properties` in the project root:

```properties
storeFile=path/to/your/keystore.jks
storePassword=your-store-password
keyAlias=your-key-alias
keyPassword=your-key-password
```

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Jetpack Compose UI        │  Kotlin / MVVM
│   (Library, Search, Player) │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   JNI Bridge                │  Kotlin external fun <-> Rust extern "C"
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   librespot (Rust)          │  Session, playback, metadata, audio decoding
│   + Tokio async runtime     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Native core**: librespot handles Spotify protocol, authentication, audio streaming, and decryption
- **JNI bridge**: Serializes data as JSON between Kotlin and Rust
- **Audio pipeline**: librespot decodes OGG Vorbis to PCM, delivers samples via JNI callback to Android AudioTrack
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Navigation, Material3, Coil for album art

## Current Limitations

- **Spotify Premium required** -- free-tier accounts are not supported by librespot
- **ARM only** -- the native library is built for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`
- **No lossless/HiFi** -- max quality is 320 kbps OGG Vorbis. Spotify's lossless tier uses DRM that librespot cannot and will not circumvent
- **Spotify Connect (receive-only)** -- pairs via Zeroconf so the official Spotify app can hand off playback to it, but it doesn't advertise/control other Connect targets itself
- **No crossfade** -- crossfade between tracks is not supported
- **No offline mode** -- streaming only, no download/cache for offline listening
- **Account risk** -- Spotify has not sanctioned third-party clients. Use at your own risk
